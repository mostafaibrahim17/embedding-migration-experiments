# The same migration, in Vespa

The runs in `../scripts/` simulate a mixed-space index with numpy and hnswlib.
This directory does it in a real engine: one index carrying two embedding fields,
a backfill that fills the second one a slice at a time, a coordinated switch of
query model and target field, and a rollback.

Status: the application package deploys and serves. The backfill, switch and
rollback runs are not written yet.

## What the schema does

`app/schemas/scifact.sd` gives every document two 384-dimensional tensor fields,
`emb_old` and `emb_new`, each with its own HNSW index at M 16 and
ef_construction 200 — the same settings as
`../scripts/stage3_hnsw_and_distant_pair.py`, so the two sets of numbers are
comparable. `distance-metric` is `prenormalized-angular` because the embedder
returns unit vectors. An `int` attribute, `space`, records which model's vector a
document is currently served from.

Three rank profiles, all deployed at once:

| Profile | What it scores | When it is used |
|---|---|---|
| `old` | `closeness(field, emb_old)` | before the migration |
| `mixed` | `max(closeness(label, "n"), closeness(label, "o"))` | during the backfill |
| `new` | `closeness(field, emb_new)` | after the switch |

The `mixed` profile is the interesting one. A single new-model query vector
reaches both graphs through two labelled `nearestNeighbor` operators, and each
document is scored in whichever space it currently lives in:

```
select doc_id from scifact where
  ({targetHits:10, label:"n"}nearestNeighbor(emb_new, q) and space = 1) or
  ({targetHits:10, label:"o"}nearestNeighbor(emb_old, q) and space = 0)
```

Taking the `max` of two closeness values computed in different embedding spaces
is exactly the comparison the article argues you cannot make. Writing it as a
rank expression makes it explicit rather than accidental.

Because the switch is a choice of rank profile and both profiles are deployed
from the start, moving the whole index from the old space to the new one is a
query parameter rather than a redeploy. The run will measure whether that holds.

## Running it

Verified on Vespa **8.763.13**, Vespa CLI 8.699.8, Docker 29.2.0 on macOS
(Apple M3 Pro, 8.2 GB given to Docker; Vespa's documented minimum is 4 GB).

```bash
docker run --detach --name vespa --hostname vespa-container \
  --publish 8080:8080 --publish 19071:19071 vespaengine/vespa:8.763.13

vespa config set target local
vespa deploy --wait 300 ./app

python3 scripts/smoke_test.py          # feeds 2 documents, runs 4 query shapes, cleans up
```

If something else on the machine already holds port 8080, publish Vespa
somewhere else and tell the smoke test where it went:

```bash
docker run --detach --name vespa --hostname vespa-container \
  --publish 8090:8080 --publish 19071:19071 vespaengine/vespa:8.763.13
VESPA_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:8090 python3 scripts/smoke_test.py
```

`vespa deploy --wait` probes the query port directly and will report an unhealthy
container in that case even though the deployment succeeded. Check
`curl http://127.0.0.1:8090/status.html` instead.

## What is verified so far

- The schema deploys: two HNSW-indexed tensor fields on one document type,
  `prenormalized-angular`, `attribute: fast-search`, and `closeness(label, ...)`
  over two labelled `nearestNeighbor` operators are all accepted.
- Two `nearestNeighbor` operators in one query, OR'd and filtered by `space`,
  return documents from both spaces in one result set, each scored in its own.
- A document with no `emb_new` never appears in the new-space graph, so
  un-migrated documents drop out of new-space retrieval rather than scoring badly.
- `approximate:false` gives exact search for a reference number, on the same
  index, without a second deployment.

## What is not verified

- **Whether a partial update to an HNSW-indexed tensor attribute avoids the
  document store read-modify-write.** Vespa's
  [partial updates](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/writing/partial-updates.html)
  documentation says most attribute fields avoid it and that index fields
  require it, but it does not say which applies to a tensor attribute that also
  carries an HNSW index. The article asserts the cheap path. The backfill run has
  to measure it rather than repeat it.
- Feed throughput, query latency during the backfill, and the memory and disk
  cost of the second vector. All unmeasured.
- Whether the rank-profile switch is really instant at the scale of a full index.
